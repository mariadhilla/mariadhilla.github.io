					<h5><i>Why does social eating matter?</i></h5>
                        
                    <p>We found that when people are eating, their moods are heavily affected by factors such as whether or not they are eating with 
						others and who they are eating with. Additionally, social eating has actually been shown to <b class="bold">build and reinforce 
						relationships</b>. Lastly, research has also shown that eating with others is correlated 
						with <b class="bold">better mental health and happiness</b>.
					</p>
					
					<p>Past research has shown that <b class="bold">co-location</b> is one of the <b class="bold">strongest predictors</b> of whether two people become friends because it affords “frequent, 
						<b class="bold">serendipitous interactions</b>.” (Predicting Tie Strength With Social Media, Gilbert & Karahalios, 2009).
					</p>

				<div class="spacer"></div>

                <div class="project-info">
					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Problem</h5>
					<h5><i>How might we streamline the planning of social eating to optimize connectivity between both weak and strong ties?</i></h5>
                    
					<p>After spending 2 years being isolated from others because of COVID-19, it is harder than ever to coordinate hangouts. This leads to an increase in people eating 
						alone. However, if we can use digital scheduling tools and integrate them into existing applications, it may make it easier for people to schedule 
						in-person hangouts and form better connections with the people around them.
					</p>

					<br>

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Why Yelp?</h5>

					<p>We came up with the idea to integrate an add-on to popular business-review app Yelp, specifically centered around restaurants. Although 
						<b class="bold">Yelp has a variety of information</b> users can access, the platform offers <b class="bold">no way for users to coordinate</b> with 
						one another with that information.
					</p>
						
					<p>Our secondary research showed the benefits of social eating, but  many don't participate in social eating due to the 
						difficulty of planning/scheduling. We saw that 84.4% of our survey respondents use Yelp to find restaurants, but only 9.4% use Yelp 
						to send recommendations to friends. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<div class="project-info">
					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Solution</h5>
					
                    <p>After completing two rounds of user testing, my teammates and I 
						built screens on Figma to show how users can opt-in to <b class="bold">YelpMe, our new add-on social feature</b>. 
						The screens demonstrate key design features that help facilitate social eating between friends and acquaintances:

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Lo-Fi Prototype - Testing</h5>

					<h6 class="bolder">User Flows</h6>
					<p>After getting to know our users better and determining our product goals, we created a user flow to help 
						us guide our iterative process and explore our design space with a shared mental model.
					</p>

					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="../images/yelp user flow 1.png" alt="user flow 1" class="img-fluid" width=auto height=auto>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>For our user testing, we provided the same social setting for participants during our prototyping sessions:</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-10">
							<p class="purple">"You are a Yelp user, and you want to check out new restaurants to eat at! You are also looking for a companion to eat with 
								you. Whether this is a person you know very well or someone who you vaguely know…it is up to you!"
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<h6 class="bolder">User Testing</h6>

					<p>During our first prototyping session, we used Google Forms to simulate our Yelp restaurant discovery/home page. The Google Form results were 
						populated in a Google Sheet where our team utilized a <b class="bold">“Wizard of Oz”</b> technique to simulate the novel interaction of seamless event 
						planning through Yelp.
					</p>
					<p>Our participants comprised of two other teams in the class. Users in this prototyping session were told that they should act as though they were all "mutuals," 
						meaning everyone had <b class="bold">weak ties</b> with each other already. However, their teammates were their <b class="bold">close friends</b>. 
					</p>

					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="../images/yelp form.png" alt="google form 1" class="img-fluid" width=auto height=auto>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>The backend on Google Sheet was performed synchronously and manually by our project team.</p>

					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="../images/yelp lofi sheet.png" alt="google sheet 1" class="img-fluid" width=auto height=auto>
					</div>
					<p class="caption">Google Form responses for two teams populated onto Google Sheets to help us determine who to group up based on the restaurant pinned. i.e. To Ellie Kanda: 
						Sophia has just pinned the same restaurant (Red Panda Express)! Set up a meeting time?
					</p>

					<p>Based on each user's response on the form, they would receive one of the following messages from us via private Zoom Messages:</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“[Name] has just pinned the same restaurant! Set up a meeting time?”</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“[Name], [Name], … have just pinned the same restaurant! Set up a meeting time?”</p>	
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>The user would not receive a message if there was no mutual/teammate that selected the same restaurants and meeting preferences as them. Based on the message(s) 
						they received, they can determine whether they want to reach out first and make a “plan” to meet at their preferred restaurant via Zoom Messages. 
					</p>	
					<p>We informed participants that an incentivizing feature to use YelpMe would be that they will get a discount at participating restaurants.

				<div class="project-info">
					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Lo-Fi Prototype - Feedback</h5>

					<p>After users played around with our prototype, we discovered potential concerns and improvements through our post-prototyping feedback form.</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“It may be awkward to get food with weak ties 1-on-1 if I'm not intending to develop a deeper bond with them. I wonder if the app would allow 
								multiple people in a friend group to plan something together.”
							</p>
							<p class="text-center">↓</p>
							<p class="bold">How can we give users more choice in who they want to meet up with?</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“Definitely focus on scenario testing in order to prevent any issue with non-matches for food meetups, maybe work on real (or fake) restaurant 
								pairings, and maybe have a toggle for random/stranger pairings!”
							</p>
							<p class="text-center">↓</p>
							<p class="bold">How can we engage users who weren't matched?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>We also received feedback that supports our intended purpose for YelpMe: an extension that would better support and build stronger relationships between a user's 
						connections, primarily amongst their weak ties: 
					</p>

					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“I think it's a nice extension on Yelp to get a more social experience. I would see this idea as a gateway to make weak ties into a stronger 
								relationship (become a way to create a friendship).”
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“Close friends, I can just text with my friends on a social media app that we use regularly. For weak ties, I may not share social media with 
								them so... I would be more inclined to use YelpMe for this.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					
					<br>
					<p>We wanted to design for experiences <b class="bold">beyond simply bookmarking</b> for Yelp users. Most participants had a good time using 
						our prototype, with many deeming the interactions as 'novel.'
					</p>

					<p>With all our user feedback compiled, we made another, more detailed user flow:</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="../images/yelp user flow 2.png" alt="google sheet 1" class="img-fluid" width=auto height=auto>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>The next step was to refine our prototype and create a more familiar interface aligning with Yelp's to replicate the intended experience more accurately.</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-10">

				<div class="project-info">
					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Hi-Fi Prototype - Testing</h5>
					<p>After considering user feedback from the previous prototyping session, we developed a high fidelity prototype of YelpMe. This time, the

					</div>
					<br>
					<p>For this prototype, we wanted to <b class="bold">give users more control</b> over who they would meet up with, rather than having us manually and randomly choose a person 
						for them to eat with. We wanted to make sure both parties were mutually interested in meeting up with each other to eat. People are only notified that someone is interested in meeting with them if they are also interested; that way users can avoid awkward situations.
					</p>
					<p> Additionally, we implemented a <b class="bold">"Privately Pin Restaurant”</b> feature for users who do not want to share certain restaurants they're interested in.</p>
					
					<p>I used <b class="bold">multiple matrices to keep track</b> of which restaurants users indicated an interest in and to calculate when two users indicated mutual interest in each other. Using this 
						information, we could <b class="bold">notify users in real time</b> when others matched with them.

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Hi-Fi Prototype - Feedback</h5>

					<p>With our new high-fidelity prototype, we conducted user testing again with the same group of participants. We split the session into two groups, and each group had a total of 10 participants. 
					</p>	
					<p>The first group used the prototype <b class="bold">simultaneously</b>, whereas the second group used the prototype in <b class="bold">increments</b>: 3 participants would use the prototype 
						at the same time for 2 minutes, then the next 3 participants would use it for 2 minutes, then the final 4 participants used it. 
					</p>
					<p>The difference in prototyping methods was meant to highlight the different experiences users would face based on their timely interactions with other users. Realistically, usage 
						of YelpMe would align more so with the incremental experience as users would most likely use the application at different times.
					</p>

					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-6">
							<p class="purple">“It is an easy, lower-stakes/expectation on meeting people you kind of know.”</p>

							<p class="purple">“I think it is an interesting idea since it shows you who is interested to go to which eating place with you. I would use it with weaker ties too to learn more about someone.”</p>

						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-4">
							<p class="purple">“For weak ties, I may be more inclined to use it because I feel like there are lower stakes involved. We both kind of know each other and we can 
								decide if we feel willing to just try and hang out.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>Many user's liked the low stakes aspect of interaction on YelpMe, and indicated a great interest in using something like YelpMe for <b class="bold">getting to know their weaker ties better</b>, as opposed to close friends. 
						All users indicated that this design was novel.
					</p>

					<p>I'm also honored to share that our <b class="bold">hi-fi prototype was chosen by the professor to be shown as an example to future students in COGS 123!</b></p>

					<br>

					<h6 class="bolder">Conclusions</h6>

					<p class="bold">Social Eating is Polarizing</p>

					<p>Users responded in a variety of ways to our prototype:</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-6">
							<p class="purple">“I'm the type of person who prefers eating alone than eating with weak ties... I feel a little bit awkward when eating with unfamiliar [people.]”</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-4">
							<p class="purple">“I feel like we can use it for strangers as well.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>As we can surmise, some users were uncomfortable with the idea of eating with their weak ties, while others were fully on-board with expanding the reach of YelpMe to include complete strangers. As we went into our final prototype, 
						we wanted to make sure that YelpMe remained a comfortable experience for all kinds of users. 
					</p>

					<p class="bold">Private and Public Pinning: The Next Novel Social Feature?</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“[Flourish] out the private pin next time. Great second round of prototyping!”</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“Nice prototype. I appreciate having a private pin as an option.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>From our user testing, one notable finding was that pinning privately is a feature that might be useful elsewhere. It may be a hidden feature that has intriguing implications 
						in online social settings, as it creates a difference between pinning restaurants for yourself vs. others. It would be interesting to study when and why people would be more inclined to privately pin a restaurant over a public 
						pin.

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Next Steps</h5>
					<p>
						Once we completed our prototypes, we had a clear idea of how this extension could expand in the future:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="li-list">Expand the meeting from 1:1 to group settings.</li>
						<li class="li-list">Embed calendar integration (Google Calendar/Microsoft Outlook)</li>
						<li class="li-list">Extend to non-restaurants (ie. various activities and locations also reviewed on Yelp)</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Thank you!</h5>
					<p>Thank you to my wonderful teammates, who were an absolute delight to work with despite the challenges we faced. Go Team Buns and Peonies!</p>
					<p>Additionally, thanks to the COGS 123 teaching team for helping us develop our project to it's full potential, as well as all of our peers and classmates who helped us with user testing!</p>
