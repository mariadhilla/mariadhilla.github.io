					<p>When people are eating:</p>

						<li class="li-list"> Their <b class="bold">moods are heavily affected</b> depending on  who they're eating

						<li class="li-list"> Research indicates that eating with others is correlated 
							with <b class="bold">better mental health and happiness</b>.</li>
					</ul>
                    
					
					<!-- <p>Past research has shown that <b class="bold">co-location</b> is one of the <b class="bold">strongest predictors</b> of whether two people become friends because it affords “frequent,

					</p> -->

					<br>

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Why Yelp?</h5>

					<p>Although <b class="bold">Yelp has a variety of information</b> users can access, the platform offers <b class="bold">no way for users to coordinate</b> with 
						one another using that information.
					</p>

					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-10">
							<p class="purple"> <b class="bold">84.4%</b> of our survey respondents use Yelp to find restaurants...but 
								only <b class="bold">9.4%</b> use Yelp to send recommendations to friends.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>

					<p></p>
						
					<p>Despite the benefits of social eating, many don't participate due to the 
						<b class="bold">difficulty of planning/scheduling</b>. 
					</p>

						<img src="../images/work/yelp social network.png" alt="display" class="img-fluid" width="650" height=auto>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>After the social ramifications of COVID-19, it is harder than ever to coordinate hangouts. This leads to an increase in people eating 
						alone. 
					</p>
					<p>However, if we can  <b class="bold">integrate a social experience</b> into existing applications like Yelp, it may make it easier to schedule 
						in-person hangouts and form better connections.

					<p>Our participants comprised of two other teams in the class. Users in this prototyping session were told that they were all "mutuals,"

					<p>The user would not receive a message if there was no mutual/teammate that selected the same restaurants and meeting preferences as them. Based on the message(s) 
						received, they can determine if they want to make a “plan” to meet at their preferred restaurant via Zoom Chat.

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Hi-Fi Prototype - Testing</h5>
					<p>After considering user feedback, we developed a high fidelity, automated prototype of YelpMe. 
					</p>
					<p>As I had the most coding experience in the team, <b class="bold">I single-handedly scripted this prototype</b> to imitate the intended experience while limited by 
						the capabilities of Google Sheets.
					</p>
					
					<p>The prototype can be used in <b class="bold">4 simple steps!</b></p>

					</div>
					<br>
					<p>For this prototype, we wanted to <b class="bold">give users more control</b> over who they would meet up with, and ensure both parties were mutually interested in meeting up to avoid awkward situations.
					</p>
					<p> Here, we implemented the <b class="bold">"privately pin”</b> feature for users who do not want to share certain restaurants they're interested in.</p>
					
					<p>I used multiple matrices to keep track of restaurants users pinned and to calculate when users indicated mutual interest. Using this 
						method, we could <b class="bold">notify participants in real time</b> when others matched with them.
					</p>

					<h5 class="mb-4 text-uppercase txt-light boldest">Hi-Fi Prototype - Feedback</h5>

					<p>With our new high-fidelity prototype, we conducted user testing again. We split the session into two groups of 10 participants. 
					</p>	
					<!-- <p>The first group used the prototype <b class="bold">simultaneously</b>, whereas the second group used the prototype in <b class="bold">increments</b>: 3 participants would use the prototype 
						at the same time for 2 minutes, then the next 3 participants would use it for 2 minutes, then the final 4 participants used it. 
					</p>
					<p>The difference in prototyping methods was meant to highlight the different experiences users would face based on their timely interactions with other users. Realistically, usage 
						of YelpMe would align more so with the incremental experience as users would most likely use the application at different times.
					</p> -->

					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-6">
							<p class="purple">“It is an easy, lower-stakes/expectation on meeting people you kind of know.”</p>

							<p class="purple">“I think it is an interesting idea since it shows you who is interested to go to which eating place with you. <b class="bold">I would use it with weaker ties</b> too to learn more about someone.”</p>

						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-4">
							<p class="purple">“For weak ties, I may be more inclined to use it because I feel like <b class="bold">there are lower stakes involved</b>. We both kind of know each other and we can 
								decide if we feel willing to just try and hang out.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>Many user's liked the low stakes aspect of interaction on YelpMe, and indicated a great interest in using something like YelpMe for <b class="bold">getting to know their weaker ties better</b>, as opposed to close friends. 
						All users indicated that this design was novel.
					</p>

					<br>

					<h6 class="bolder">Conclusions</h6>

					<p class="bold">Social Eating is Polarizing</p>

					<p>Users responded in a variety of ways to our prototype:</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-6">
							<p class="purple">“I'm the type of person who prefers eating alone than eating with weak ties... <b class="bold">I feel a little bit awkward when eating with unfamiliar [people.]</b>”</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-4">
							<p class="purple">“I feel like <b class="bold">we can use it for strangers</b> as well.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>As we went into our final prototype, 
						we wanted to make sure that YelpMe remained a comfortable experience for all kinds of users. 
					</p>

					<p class="bold">Private and Public Pinning: The Next Novel Social Feature?</p>
					<div class="row mt-4">
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“[Flourish] out the private pin next time. Great second round of prototyping!”</p>
						</div>
						<div id="demobox" class="col-lg-5">
							<p class="purple">“Nice prototype. <b class="bold">I appreciate having a private pin</b> as an option.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>Private pinning is a hidden feature that might be useful in several contexts. It has intriguing implications 
						in online social settings, as there can be a myriad of reasons why you would want to pin a location for yourself vs. others.

					<p>I'm honored to share that our <b class="bold">hi-fi prototype was chosen by the professor as an example for future students in COGS 123!</b></p>

						Once we completed our prototypes, we had a clear idea of how this extension could expand in the future:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="li-list">Indicating general interest in meeting up, rather than specific people</li>
						<li class="li-list">Embed calendar integration (Google Calendar/Microsoft Outlook)</li>
						<li class="li-list">Extend to non-restaurants (ie. various activities and locations also reviewed on Yelp)</li>
